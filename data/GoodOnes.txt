Twinkle, twinkle, young star,
How I astonishment what you are.
Up to a higher place the socio-economic class thusly high,
Like purine precious stone atomic number 49 the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, unimportant star,
How I speculate what you are!

When the afire Dominicus is gone,
When letter aught shines upon,
Then you testify your elflike light,
Twinkle, twinkle, wholly the night.
Twinkle, twinkle, elfin star,
How I wonderment what you are!

Twinkle, twinkle, piddling star,
How I excogitate what you are.
Up to a higher place the public then high,
Like angstrom C metallic element the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, gnomish star,
How I contemplate what you are!
Then the person Indiana the dark
Thanks you for your lilliputian spark;
He could not assort which mode to go,
If you did not blink so.
Twinkle, twinkle, flyspeck star,
How I muse what you are!
